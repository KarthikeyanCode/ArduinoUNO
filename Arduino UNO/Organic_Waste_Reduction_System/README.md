# Vegetables and Fruits Waste Reduction System

- Here we have interfaced Gas and Temprature sensor in each slave (create) Arduino which checks for the suitable environment for the vegetables and fruits and updates to the main (master) arduino through I2C.

- We have also interfaced microbit for the rankings of crates as to which crate of vegetable has to be delivered first and LCD screen to show the status of each crate.
